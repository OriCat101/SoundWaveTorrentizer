# The Idea 
## Description:
A script that can analyse the files and generates a media info table and optionally uploads the spectrogram.

It outputs bbcode table into your clipboard for use on various forums.

### Example output:
![example output.png](doc%2Fimages%2Fexample%20output.png)

## Smol bits:
- [x] analyse quality of the album (avg. Bitrate etc.)
- [x] Generate a spectrograph
- [x] upload spectrograph 
- [x] output bbCode
- [x] generate .torrent 
- [x] add support for Markdown
- [x] add support for multi dis albums/collections
- [ ] Basic console UI
- [ ] Write usage guide
- [ ] (advanced) upload using UNIT3D api

Missing features? Want to Implement a new API? Want to support other file Types?
Heck yeh! go for it, Contribution is encuraged and welcome 

## Disclaimer:
The code runs and does it is job but it isn't what id call good code, at least rn.
